  # Low-level connection object for communicating with the NXT brick
  # via USB.

  # It's interface is very simple and mainly deals with bytes `pack`ed
  # into `String`s.
  #
  # Example of packing:
  #
  #     [ 0x80, 0x03].pack('C*')
  #
  # Example of unpacking
  #
  #     bytestring.unpack('C*')
